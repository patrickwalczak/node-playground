### ðŸ“„ Your code

```js
const http = require('http')

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  console.log('request event')
  res.end('Hello World')
})

server.listen(5000, () => {
  console.log('Server listening on port : 5000....')
})
```

---

### ðŸ”Ž Step-by-step with the event loop

1. **Synchronous startup**

   * `require('http')` loads the `http` module.
   * `http.createServer(...)` creates a server object (an `EventEmitter`) and attaches your callback to its `"request"` event.
   * `server.listen(5000, ...)` tells Node to start listening on port `5000`.

     * Under the hood, Node asks the OS to open port 5000 for incoming connections.
     * The callback (`() => console.log(...)`) is registered for the `"listening"` event.

---

2. **Event loop begins**

   * At this point, Nodeâ€™s call stack is empty.
   * The event loop goes into its **poll phase**, waiting for events (like incoming network requests).

---

3. **`listening` event**

   * When the server successfully binds to port 5000, Node emits a `"listening"` event.
   * The event loop picks up this event, finds your callback, and runs:

     ```
     Server listening on port : 5000....
     ```

---

4. **Incoming request**

   * A client (e.g., browser or `curl`) makes an HTTP request to `http://localhost:5000/`.
   * The OS notifies Node â†’ libuv places a `"request"` event in the event loopâ€™s queue.
   * The event loop dequeues this and calls your registered callback `(req, res) => {...}`.

---

5. **Request handler runs**

   * Inside the callback:

     ```js
     console.log('request event');
     res.end('Hello World');
     ```
   * `console.log` runs immediately.
   * `res.end('Hello World')` sends a response back to the client.

---

6. **Loop continues**

   * After finishing, the call stack is empty again.
   * The event loop returns to **poll** mode, waiting for more connections or other async work.

---

### âœ… In short

* On startup â†’ synchronous setup.
* Event loop goes idle (polling).
* `"listening"` event fires â†’ logs the server message.
* Each new request fires a `"request"` event â†’ runs your callback â†’ sends a response.
* The event loop keeps running as long as the server is open.

---

ðŸ‘‰ So this tiny server is a **perfect demo of the event loop**:

* Setup runs once synchronously.
* The server then lives in the event loop, responding to `"request"` events forever.

---

Do you want me to also draw a **visual timeline of this event loop flow** (startup â†’ listening â†’ request â†’ poll â†’ repeat) so itâ€™s easier to picture?
