When you’re running a React app with Vite in dev mode (npm run dev), all files are served by the Vite dev server, not Express.

🔹 How Vite dev server works in dev mode

Vite doesn’t “bundle everything upfront” like Webpack.

Instead, it:

  Serves your index.html as the entry point.

  Uses native ES modules in the browser → when the browser requests /src/App.jsx, Vite transforms it (adds JSX → JS, TypeScript → JS, etc.) and sends it back.

  Serves CSS, images, assets directly.

  Provides Hot Module Replacement (HMR), so changes reload instantly without full page reload.

👉 So in dev:

http://localhost:5173/ → Vite sends index.html.

http://localhost:5173/src/App.jsx → Vite transforms and serves your React component.

http://localhost:5173/src/style.css → served as CSS.

Express is not involved at all here — only the Vite server.


🔹 What happens in prod mode

When you run:

npm run build


Vite builds everything into a /dist folder:

dist/
 ├── index.html
 ├── assets/
 │    ├── index-abc123.js
 │    ├── index-def456.css


These are static files (optimized JS, CSS, HTML).

Then Express, Nginx, Netlify, or Vercel serves those files.

👉 So in prod:

Express (or another server) is responsible for serving React’s static output.

Dev: Vite dev server serves everything (files are transformed on-demand, not pre-built).
Prod: Vite builds to /dist, then Express or another server serves those files.
